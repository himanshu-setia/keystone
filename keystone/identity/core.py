    See :mod:`keystone.common.manager.Manager` for more details on how this
    dynamically calls the backend.

    This class also handles the support of account specific backends, by using
    the AccountConfigs class. The setup call for AccountConfigs is called
    from with the @accounts_configured wrapper in a lazy loading fashion
    to get around the fact that we can't satisfy the assignment api it needs
    from within our __init__() function since the assignment driver is not
    itself yet initialized.

    Each of the identity calls are pre-processed here to choose, based on
    account, which of the drivers should be called. The non-account-specific
    driver is still in place, and is used if there is no specific driver for
    the account in question (or we are not using multiple account drivers).

    Starting with Juno, in order to be able to obtain the account from
    just an ID being presented as part of an API call, a public ID to account
    and local ID mapping is maintained.  This mapping also allows for the local
    ID of drivers that do not provide simple UUIDs (such as LDAP) to be
    referenced via a public facing ID.  The mapping itself is automatically
    generated as entities are accessed via the driver.

    This mapping is only used when:
    - the entity is being handled by anything other than the default driver, or
    - the entity is being handled by the default LDAP driver and backward
    compatible IDs are not required.

    This means that in the standard case of a single SQL backend or the default
    settings of a single LDAP backend (since backward compatible IDs is set to
    True by default), no mapping is used. An alternative approach would be to
    always use the mapping table, but in the cases where we don't need it to
    make the public and local IDs the same. It is felt that not using the
    mapping by default is a more prudent way to introduce this functionality.
